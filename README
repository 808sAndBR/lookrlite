# LookR Lite
LookR Lite is a package for accessing the Looker API through HTTP requests. It's meant to be light-weight and extensible, providing just the barebone functions for putting together R functions that send HTTP requests to Looker API endpoints and receive data back. It is based on Scott Hoover's [LookR package](https://github.com/looker/lookr).
